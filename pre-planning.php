                            <p>We plan ahead for most things in life and pre-planning a funeral is natural too.  In 2007, the AARP conducted a survey and found that 23% of people over the age of 50 had pre-arranged their funeral.  Pre-planning provides you with time to make end-of-life decisions in a calm and rational atmosphere and alleviates the stress and of loved ones making these decisions for you.  We can work with you and Medicaid to create a trust to aid in the spend down process.  We also provide refundable, transferable contracts and will work to ensure your plans stay intact if you move or spend winters elsewhere.</p>
