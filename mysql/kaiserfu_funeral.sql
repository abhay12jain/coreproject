She discovered what the Bible teaches us, that we all fall short of the glory of God and we need a Savior because our sin separates us from God. Molly was seeking God in her life and was doing well. Then we lost touch and I had not seen her in over a year. God blessed me with the opportunity to see and pray with her a few weeks ago. She desired to get right with God, others, and herself.

You have lost both father and mother.  Itâ€™s a lot to take.  Aunt Roselyn faced her trial with great confidence and courage.  One reason for that was how wonderfully you all cared for her and blessed her.  She was glad to have her four boys and their wives living nearby!  She was blessed to know all of her grandchildren and be able to spend time with them.  She loved each one and wanted the best for all of you.  \r\n\r\n     Aunt Roselyn was a spunky, cheerful, energetic, God-loving woman.  We are so thankful to have gotten to know her.  Even to the end she persevered in trust and praise.  As you may know, Paul and I were praying for her miraculous healing.  Paul was praying for her tumor to shrivel up and die.  Outside of our apartment is a dead tree and he took a picture of it to remind himself and others to pray that Aunt Roselynâ€™s cancer would dry up just like that tree!  During one of our prayer sessions I read Jeremiah 33: 4 â€œI will build you up again, and you, Virgin Israel, will be rebuilt.  Again you will take up your timbrels and go out to dance with the joyful.â€  Aunt Roselyn liked that verse, but she said, â€œinstead of the tambourines, I would rather be waterskiing!â€  I thought that was a funny reply, but so typical!  One day as I was praying for her, I saw an image of Jesus coming to her, and her tired face lit up with a great big, wide smile.  Then as I was looking at her face, I saw that her hair had grown a bit and was blowing backwards as if she was facing a fan.  As soon as I thought that, the scene changed and I saw her waterskiing with great style, sliding back and forth over the wake, jumping high.  Of course I hoped  that this was a picture of her physical healing on earth, but I also knew it could be a picture of her entering in to her reward.  She fought the good fight!  She is done with the pain and the waiting and the worry associated with this life.  She has committed you all in the hands of Jesus and He will be faithful to each of you during this time of grief.  \r\n\r\nWe love you!\r\nCheryl & Paul\r\nDavid, Bethany, Luke, and Maria\r\nAug 10, 2020\r\n','Cheryl','deMena','5edfcd0e19bd2f8c5fc417512c22b6bd.jpg','aunt','cdemena@pobox.com','Shamong','NJ','23.89.122.195','y','2020-08-10 05:13:34','2020-08-10 12:27:55'),(255,96,'Sending my love and condolences to Ashley, Mr. and Mrs. Pickel and the entire Pickel family.

Someone said to take a long look at the potential brideâ€™s mother because your â€œsweet heartâ€ will probably be a lot like her in a few years. So when Nancy and I were â€œseriouslyâ€ dating, I did take a careful look at Edith. As a result I was much encouraged to keep up the pursuit of Nancy. \r\n     Edith struck me as classy, refined, pleasant, funny, kind and industrious...in short a â€œvirtuous womanâ€ [Proverbs 31:10].  She reminded me of the things Paul urged us to think about in Philippians 4:8 : â€œwhatever is ... true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent and praiseworthy...think on these thingsâ€.\r\n    During these 42 years of marriage I never could identify with those â€œmother in law jokesâ€. Edith was the exact opposite of that prying, disrespectful, hyper-critical stereotype. She was gracious and accommodating toward me. She was always kind and accepting, always overlooking my faults and seeing the best in me. Of course she was that way with others as well.\r\n    As the years went, by the qualities of genuine Christian love that Paul lists were manifested in her life.  \r\nLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Corinthians 13:4-7\r\n    Leah, our first child, was born in 1980 while we were working in a church in Lakeland Florida. When the offer came for us to return to Western New York to serve in a church in Orchard Park, we readily accepted; in large part because we wanted our children to be regularly exposed to the love and influence of Edith and Bill Wilson. \r\n     Edith had a selfless, servant heart. She did â€œnot seek her own good but the good of othersâ€ (1 Corinthians 10:24). I saw this most clearly when we got to go to the cottage on Turtle Lake in Gravenhurst, Canada for a week in the summer.  She pretty much planned and produced every meal so the rest of us could just play and enjoy the place. She got her joy by making others happy.  She did this not only by her selfless service but also by her wit. She loved to lighten the load of others with a funny comment or quip.  During those difficult last years in the nursing home she was admired by the aides as the patient, quiet, never complaining one. But we have also heard from them, (and others who visited) that her buoyant sense of humor was still strong though her body was weak. \r\n      Edithâ€™s life on earth is now done. She was trusting in Christ for her salvation. She kept the faith till the end. We have been blessed by the beauties of Christ that He produced in her. May we, who are still here, run our race as well as she ran herâ€™s.\r\n\r\n2 Timothy 4:7,8  I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day â€” and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. \r\n','Douglas','Sukhia','','Son','desukhia@gmail.com','Orchard Park','NY','68.133.71.198','y','2020-12-16 19:23:04','2020-12-17 17:53:57'),(442,126,'She was, and IS, a sweet godly lady.

This strong, sarcastic, humorous warrior beat Cerebral palsy, renal kidney failure (2 separate transplants approx. 10yrs ea.) PTLD cancer, as well as, a laundry list of others. Moe graduated GIHS class of &#39;08 with a local diploma (WOOT WOOT!!) He &#39;worked&#39; (mostly socializing) at the previously known restaurant, McMahon&#39;s and attended Tech Today (Tonawanda) as well as Elmwood Day Hab (People&#39;s Inc.) He vastly enjoyed playing video games (frequently baiting his brother to assist in the game only to &#39;off&#39; his player.) He also played baseball with Miracle League . Moe was extremely social. &quot;Chatty Kathy&quot; had many friends and was quite the ladies man (insert tiger growl, &amp; WINK WINK.) Very opinionated and never afraid to share it, you always knew where you stood (or in his case sat,) with Moe. Known mostly for his versatile palate (inset his snorting laughter) and amazing professional wheel driving skills (or as he thought bumper cars.) Preceded in death by his maternal grandparents Jack (John) and Ginny (Virginia) Tornabene and paternal grandmother Diane Dinsmore.

As well as a very large family and even more friends. Words could not begin to describe the positivity and strength he radiated in his 30yrs of reign. It was an honor to have a part in his most amazing journey.

(Walker) Bobak. Incredible father to 10 children: Melanie (Josh) McCallen, Robin (John Henry) Crosby, Sean (Mary) Bobak, Kelly (Theodore) Smith, Christian (Christyn), Brian (Julia), Maura, Michael (Grace), John-Paul and Mary Clare Bobak. Amazing grandfather to 26 grandchildren: Maggie, Connor, Maria, Monica, Charlie, Colman, Molly, Martha, Miriam and Coyle McCallen, Magdalene, Robin Miriam, John Henry Jr. and Peter Crosby., Sean Jr., Paul, George, Samuel and Patrick Bobak, Francis and Lucy Smith, Kolbe, Joan and Brigid Bobak. He is the loving brother of his siblings Rita, Daniel, Lauretta, Patricia, Edward, Jerome, Katie and Theresa.&nbsp;Marty was born June 15, 1957 in Niagara Falls, the son of Mary K. Zaccarella and the late Andrew E. Bobak. He attended St John De Lasalle Elementary and Bishop Duffy High School.&nbsp;After marrying his high school sweetheart, he enjoyed a highly decorated 23-year military career in the United States Air Force, where he remarkably won Officer of the Year for the entire Air Force on two separate occasions. After retirement, he went on to be a transformational executive for the Military Aircraft Group within the Moog corporation where he worked for 24 years.&nbsp;His greatest treasures will always be his family and his faith. On a military salary, Marty sacrificed everything to put his children through Catholic schools and send them to Franciscan University. He was a faithful parishioner of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Catholic Church on Grand Island where you could find him coaching basketball, teaching confirmation, on stage with the Parish Players, or the last man cleaning up from the Lenten fish fries. He could be seen around town, always hand in hand with his youngest autistic daughter Mary Clare, whom he counted as his greatest blessing from God.&nbsp;It is almost impossible to imagine the many thousands of lives Marty has touched with his remarkable humility, his limitless generosity, and his tireless faith. It is equally impossible to imagine our lives moving forward without him here.&nbsp;Visitation will be held Friday 4-8 PM at St. Stephen&#39;s Catholic Church 2100 Baseline Rd., Grand Island . Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Saturday at 9:30 am. at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Catholic Church. All are welcome to attend!

His strong will to live was inspiring, and he is sadly missed by his family. Emil was born in Yonkers, N.Y. on&nbsp;February 8, 1924, to Emil and Anna (Weiser) Geering. He was raised in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and spent much time in his parents&rsquo; bakery. Many tales are told of his boyhood mischievousness there! He received his B. S. From Hobart College while in the U. S. Navy V-12 program. He served in the Navy in WWII for three years, mostly on the USS Gazelle, a tanker in the Pacific theater. In 1945 he was honorably discharged as a lieutenant (j.g.) He worked for several years at Best Foods Company in New Jersey, then went on to get an M.S., and in 1950 a PhD in organic chemistry (both at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.) He was married to Marion Petchel in the Lady Chapel of Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in New York City on&nbsp;July 25, 1953, and he and his wife moved to Western NY in 1954. He was employed at Hooker/Occidental for 37 years, during which time he earned 49 patents. He was a manager in Research and Development, and later in Technical Services. During this period he also earned an MBA from the State University of NY at Buffalo. He was a member of the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemists. Emil was a man of many talents: woodworking, including furniture and sculpture; piano playing on his beloved Steinway; gardening; bookbinding; cooking and baking artisanal breads; and abstract painting (for which he was honored with an exhibit at Manhattan College in NYC.) He coordinated many blood drives on Grand Island for the American Red Cross, and served on the Grand Island Memorial Library board for nine years, five as president. A frequently used expression of his was, &ldquo;Everything is relative,&ldquo; which his wife joked would be on his tombstone someday as it so aptly depicted his outlook on life and being. He lovingly cared for his dear wife through her long illness and death in 2009. Failing health eventually dictated that he move to Crescent Springs, Kentucky to live with his oldest daughter, Anne (Rick) Gaunder, and then to a nursing home. His other beloved children are Timothy (Linda) Geering, Mason, OH; Mary Louise Geering, Brooklyn, NY; and John (Kris) Geering, Mountain View, CA. He is survived by nine grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and his older sister, Anna Cross of Pittsfield, MA.&nbsp;Funeral arrangements will be private due to COVID concerns. Burial will be in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cemetery, Grand Island, New York. Condolences may be offered at kaiserfuneral.com. Memorial contributions may be sent to Grand Island Memorial Library, 1715 Bedell Rd., Grand Island, NY 14072.

He was 91 years old. Born to the late Joseph and Elsie Crowe, he grew up in admiration and respect of his father and uncle who rose to Captain and Chief in the Niagara Falls Fire Department. Their influence sparked a lifelong interest in firefighting. He was a 1948 graduate of Niagara Falls High School. Crowe was a long-time administrator at Moore Business Forms Research Center on Grand Island. He started in Product Development and retired as Director of Legal and Analytical Services in 1994. He began his military career in 1947 by enlisting in US Navy Reserve in 1951. He was activated with attack Squadron VA-859 for duty with Carrier A. Discharged in 1952, he enrolled at Niagara University and its ROTC program. He was commissioned as a 2nd Lt in 1955 and was assigned to the famed 31st Infantry Regiment and later Korean Military Advisory Group. He completed his active duty with the 4th Regiment Combat Team at Ft. Devons, Mass. in 1957. It was at Niagara University that he met Mary Ann Kumro Crowe &ndash; the love of his life and wife of 64 years. He remained committed to Niagara University for the rest of his life. He and Mary Ann received the 2010 Alumni of the Year Award. Crowe joined the New York Army National Guard&rsquo;s 27th Armored Division Support Command in Buffalo. He transferred to the USAR&rsquo;s 1151st Army Reserve Forces School, which he later commanded. Col. Crowe&rsquo;s last command was the 2nd Brigade 98th Division Training. He received multiple military honors during his career and was inducted into the Niagara University ROTC Hall of Fame. Crowe raised five children: M. Kate Olin, Peg White (Randy), Daniel G.
